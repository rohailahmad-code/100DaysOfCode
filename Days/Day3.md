## Class Components

<hr>

A class components is a more featured way to define a react component. It also acts like a function that receives Props, but that function also considers a private internal state as additional input that controls the returned JSX.

<hr>

## useState()

<hr>

useState is a hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initail state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.


<hr>

## Statefull and Stateless Components

<hr>

Statefull and Stateless Components have many different names, T

They are also known as:
- Container vs Presentational Components
- Smart vs Dumb Components

The literal difference is that one has state and the other doesn't. That means the statefull components are keeping track of changing data, while stateless components print out what is given to the via Props, or they always render the same thing.
